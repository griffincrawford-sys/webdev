        <h3>Breakfast</h3>
        
        <p>A waffle, eggs, bacon, toast, and hash also known as the All Star Meal at Waffle House is my favorite Breakfat Meal beause it has everything you could want in a meal. It may not be the healthiest meal but it sure is good. </p>

        <h3>Lunch</h3>

        <p>My favorite lunch would be 1 and a half rack of ribs, texas taost, baked beans, and colesaw. Its a good ole southern bbq dish and the best drink to wash all of that down with would of course be a big ole stirofome cup of sweet tea with ice. </p>

      <h3>Dinner</h3>
      <p>My favorite Dinner Meal would be a big Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, mash potatos, and some steamed broccoli. This plate would be the healthiest of my ideal meals because its packed with protein with vegetables to get in your green and a little carbs. This is an expensive dish but a delcious one.</p>

      <h3>Dessert</h3>
      <p>Im not a huge dessert person but if i had to choose my favortive dessert if would be a warm blackberry cobbler with a cold scoop of a vanilla icecream. I love the contast between the hot cobbler with the freezing icecream. Its delicious when the cobbler melts the icecream a little bit.</p>
